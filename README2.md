# üß† Focal AI: Multi-Agent AI Requirement Refinement System

## üéØ What We're Building

**Focal AI** is an intelligent requirement refinement system that simulates a multi-stakeholder product development meeting using AI agents. Instead of spending hours in traditional stakeholder meetings, our system uses 5 specialized AI agents to analyze product ideas from different perspectives and generate comprehensive, actionable requirements in minutes.

## üöÄ How It Works

### 1. **Multi-Agent AI Simulation**
Our system employs 5 specialized AI agents, each representing a key stakeholder in product development:

- **ü§ñ Business Manager**: Focuses on profitability, scalability, market opportunities, and revenue models
- **‚öôÔ∏è Engineer**: Analyzes technical feasibility, implementation complexity, and technology stack considerations
- **üé® Designer**: Evaluates usability, aesthetics, user experience, and interface design
- **üë§ Customer**: Represents end-user needs, pain points, and real-world usage scenarios
- **üìã Product Manager**: Balances trade-offs, prioritizes features, and develops product strategy

### 2. **AI-Powered Debate Process**
1. **Input**: User submits a product idea description
2. **Analysis**: Each AI agent independently analyzes the idea from their perspective
3. **Debate**: Agents provide structured feedback including thoughts, considerations, challenges, and suggestions
4. **Synthesis**: The system aggregates all perspectives into refined requirements, trade-offs, and next steps

### 3. **Intelligent Output Generation**
The system produces three key deliverables:
- **Refined Requirements**: 5-8 actionable, prioritized requirements
- **Trade-offs**: Key decisions and their implications
- **Next Steps**: Concrete action items with timeline suggestions

## üèó Technical Architecture

### Backend Stack
- **Framework**: Django 4.2 with REST API
- **AI Integration**: LangChain + Google Gemini AI (gemini-1.5-flash)
- **Database**: MongoDB with PyMongo
- **Key Libraries**: 
  - `langchain-google-genai==2.1.9` for AI agent orchestration
  - `langchain-core==0.3.74` for prompt management
  - `google-generativeai==0.8.5` for Gemini API integration

### Frontend Stack
- **Framework**: Next.js 15 with TypeScript
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS 4
- **UI Components**: Custom React components with modern design
- **State Management**: React hooks for local state

### Database Schema
```javascript
// Ideas Collection
{
  _id: ObjectId,
  title: String,           // Truncated idea title
  description: String,     // Full idea description
  created_at: DateTime,
  updated_at: DateTime
}

// Debates Collection
{
  _id: ObjectId,
  idea_id: String,         // Reference to idea
  round_number: Number,    // Debate round
  agent_name: String,      // Agent name (Business Manager, Engineer, etc.)
  message: String,         // Agent's response
  timestamp: DateTime
}

// Requirements Collection
{
  _id: ObjectId,
  idea_id: String,         // Reference to idea
  refined_requirements: String,
  trade_offs: String,
  next_steps: String,
  created_at: DateTime
}
```

## üîß Core Implementation Details

### Multi-Agent System (`multi_agent.py`)
```python
class MultiAgentSystem:
    def __init__(self):
        # Configure Gemini AI with gemini-1.5-flash model
        self.llm = ChatGoogleGenerativeAI(
            model="gemini-1.5-flash",
            temperature=0.7
        )
        
        # Define 5 agent personas with specialized prompts
        self.agents = {
            'business_manager': {...},
            'engineer': {...},
            'designer': {...},
            'customer': {...},
            'product_manager': {...}
        }
```

**Key Features:**
- **Rate Limit Optimization**: Single-round debates to minimize API calls (5 vs 10 calls per idea)
- **Fallback Responses**: Intelligent fallback when API quotas are exceeded
- **Structured Prompts**: Each agent has a specialized system prompt and focus area
- **Error Handling**: Graceful degradation with meaningful fallback responses

### API Endpoints
```python
# POST /api/refine/
# Input: {"idea": "Product idea description"}
# Output: Refined requirements, debate log, and structured sections

# GET /api/history/
# Output: Recent ideas with debate counts and requirements

# GET /api/idea/<id>/
# Output: Detailed idea information with full debate history
```

### Frontend Components
- **IdeaInput**: Text area for product idea submission with helpful tips
- **ResultsDisplay**: Tabbed interface showing refined requirements and AI debate
- **HistoryPanel**: Collapsible panel showing past ideas and their outcomes
- **LoadingSpinner**: Visual feedback during AI processing

## üé® User Experience Flow

1. **Input Phase**: User enters a detailed product idea description
2. **Processing**: System shows loading state with "AI stakeholders are debating your idea..."
3. **Results Display**: Two-tab interface:
   - **Refined Requirements**: Clean, formatted requirements document
   - **AI Stakeholder Debate**: Full conversation showing each agent's perspective
4. **History**: Side panel showing past ideas for reference

## üîç Key Technical Challenges Solved

### 1. **API Rate Limiting**
- **Problem**: Google Gemini free tier has 50 requests/day limit
- **Solution**: 
  - Reduced from 2 rounds to 1 round (5 API calls vs 10)
  - Implemented intelligent fallback responses
  - Graceful degradation when limits are hit

### 2. **Import Compatibility**
- **Problem**: LangChain package version conflicts and import errors
- **Solution**: 
  - Updated to compatible versions (`langchain-google-genai==2.1.9`)
  - Fixed import paths (`langchain_core.prompts` instead of `langchain.prompts`)
  - Resolved Python 3.9 compatibility issues

### 3. **Structured Output Parsing**
- **Problem**: AI responses need to be parsed into structured sections
- **Solution**: 
  - Implemented section-based parsing (Refined Requirements, Trade-offs, Next Steps)
  - Robust error handling for malformed responses
  - Fallback to raw text if parsing fails

### 4. **Real-time User Feedback**
- **Problem**: AI processing takes time, need to keep users engaged
- **Solution**: 
  - Loading states with descriptive messages
  - Progress indicators and professional UI
  - Error handling with helpful messages

## üìä Performance Optimizations

### API Efficiency
- **Single Round Debates**: 50% reduction in API calls
- **Fallback Responses**: Continues working even when rate limited
- **Caching**: MongoDB storage for reuse of previous analyses

### User Experience
- **Progressive Loading**: Immediate feedback, then detailed results
- **Responsive Design**: Works on desktop and mobile
- **Error Recovery**: Clear error messages and retry options

## üöÄ Deployment & Configuration

### Environment Setup
